Looking for enhancements on how to use code assistents, just like you Gemini CLI, I'm researching a way to improve and organize the interactions, in order to keep it as likely an asset to the projects that use that service. 
While using the tool, I noticed that once the code is implemented, and there are bugs found, the debugging and fixing of it takes a large percentage of the overall iteraction, leaving the context very large, and sometimes difficult to follow on the next iteractions of the same session.
Also when I as a user want to pursue different directions/approachs to tackle the same objective, it keeps being added to the same conversation history, also making the conversation history very large, and sometimes confusing to the LLM to understand in the context.
Thus, I'm looking to write a paper proposing two enhancements:
- First would be to address the debugging side quests, that are not very meaningful to the overall iteraction history. The idea is whenever a bug is found, it would branch to a different chat, and once it is solved only the summary of the bug found and how was fixed is returned back to the main chat
- Second, would be to address experimenting different approachs to the same objective, for that we would implement a function where the user would be able to fork/branch the conversation, and continue it in different ones.

For now in order to analize how effective it would be, and collect evidences, so I'm providing a sample of a conversation with gemini, in JSON format, copied from where Gemini CLI saves it.
 So I would like you to create a python code that would get this JSON (I believe you know its format and specifications, if not resarch for it), and analize that, looking for iteractions where a bug is found, until is solved, and branch it either in a new file, and in the original put only the summary of what was the issue and how was addressed (bery brief desctiption). Also I would like a separated json file with a a brief description of each steps of the iteraction, kind of a summary of the overall iteraction history.
 For that you can create a python code that will call the Gemini LLM, that will handle the analysis and determin when to branch and go back to the main track. As the conversation is very long, I'd suggest to send in chunks, of every 5 iteractions, along with the summary json, so the LLM will know the context.
 please have the code to use an .env file with the varaiable
